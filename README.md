# Hybrid Near/Far-Field Channel Prediction for RIS-Aided LEO Satellite Networks

We highly respect reproducible research, so we try to provide the simulation codes for our submitted papers. Please refer to the following paper for more details.

You can directly run the “main_CP.py” file to obtain the channel prediction results. Now, this code is a preliminary version composed of a few redundant statements, we will try my best to release the clean codes and add the necessary annotations in the future. 

The author in charge of this simulation code package is: Jian Xiao (email: jianx@mails.ccnu.edu.cn). If you have any queries, please don’t hesitate to contact me.
